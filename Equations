Ohms law and reference difference allows using the know good values to find the difference from the expected results.
After determing the difference we can estimate the undefined loss or difference from what was predefined.
Using ohms law and reference difference together we can redefine the values to be much more accurately calculated and now are known to be good.

X proportional to Y
Y proportional to X
Z Inverse to X
Y proportion to Z
Temp ≠ target; for temp,Y *do not use 0.0-9.0 Use ohms law After the calculation has been made normal variable use should be able to be used with the new values. 
Reason for using constant at this stage is to prevent incorrect values being used for characterization

if Z for tempX<targetX z_corrected is positive number; if tempX>TargetX Z_corrected returns a negative number
new view for baseline, [ X;Y;Z ]give us our baseline corrected view equivalent to original view, correcting for the original weighted members being set incorrectly for the current condition of actual device.
Without limits to when calls are made and when adjustments are allowed will cause undesired behaviour as heat loss and gain will cause new view to become >plane-1 Reason for execution is actual has become < plane-1
coefficients with power of two and z power of one (xx/z yyz) this is the desired intent. To correct when weighted members has been determined to be set incorrectly by sampling after "max" charge cycle did not achieve a full charge after cycle completed and temperatures are within "target range" 
Recommend only using targeting when a new _view is being made. Do not allow continuous monitoring causes race condition. 
Remaining_level_layer should execute on original and not on copy.
Only use when an error occurs with target not achieved.
Use this only as a maintenance tool.
Always set a max limit for allowed "expansion" as with no limits variables grow to infinity.
If used as equation only it works well for physics suite for finding unknown weights.
XY = W, i=it/t where t is time. induced current is equal to the total induced current over time <-current loss over time=net induced current or i=Qt/t where Q is net current induced over time equally dependent on the avg current induced over time.
When current strategy is not a constant current rate for the full duration of charge cycle the rate of charge is not constant. If an incorrect calculation is being used to set target then incorrect charging strategy or current induction may be used.
By using a training session and resolving for any attribute variables that could not otherwise have been defined, characterizing the undefined difference allows for improvement

//A new avg charge strategy to help the total induced current is needed so that the avg current induced over time will result in temp X_max=target X_max/
