When weighted members are greater than expected and actual X is not equal to target X
Target (1)
Actual (2)
Desired (3)
X proportional equal to y
Y proportional equal to x
Z Inverse to x
X2 not=X1
Z2(X2/Y1) ; Zn(Z1-Z2) ; Z3(Z1+Zn) ; Z4(Z1+(Zn/2)) \\ adjustable weighted members
X3(Z3*Y1) ; X4(Z4*Y1) *if ZN unknown for expectedX<TargetX zn is positive number; if expectedX>TargetX Zn returns a negative number
logY(X3\Z3) ; Y3(X4\Z3) depending on (logy xx\z) ; (xx\z yy\z)= proportional xy
Return(X3,X4;Z3)
( X3 ; X4 ); Z3>Target
X3 ; Z3=Target *use X3 logY
X4 ; Z3=Target *use x4 for coeffecients with power of two and z power of one
*Zn is the unknown difference of the Z component when weighted members are not same as expected
