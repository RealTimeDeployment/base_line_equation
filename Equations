When weighted members are greater than expected and actual X is not equal to target X
Target (1)
Actual (2)
Desired (3)
X proportional equal to y
Y proportional equal to x
Z Inverse to x
X2 not=X1 ; Y1(X1/Z1)*do not use 0.0-9.0 Use ohms law 
Z2(X2/Y1) ; Zn(Z1-Z2)*difference ; Z3(Z1+Zn) ; Z4(Z1+(Zn/2)) \\ adjusted weighted members
X3(Z3*Y1) ; X4(Z4*Y1) *if ZN unknown for expectedX<TargetX zn is positive number; if expectedX>TargetX Zn returns a negative number
logYlog depending on what is being targeted to be found,(logy xx\z)unequal xy ; (xx\z yy\z)= proportional xy
Return(X4;Z3)
(X4;Z3) = new view only *do not use as new target or allow orginal target to change. Without limits to when calls are made and when adjustments are allowed will cause undesired behaviour
X3 ; Z3=  *use X3 for logY only when amps is required to remain static for finding pool_available<needed
X4 ; Z3=Target *use x4 for coefficients with power of two and z power of one
*Zn is the unknown difference of the Z component when weighted members are not the same as expected. Recommend only using targeting when a new af_create_view is being made. Do not allow continuous monitoring.
Only use when an error occurs with target not achieved. Use this only as a maintenance tool. If used as equation only works well for physics suite for finding unknown weights.
