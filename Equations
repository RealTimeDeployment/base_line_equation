When two components are proportionally equal and one component is inverse and proportional inversely equal to the other two components
Target (1)
Actual (2)
Desired (3)
X="proportional"
Y="proportional"
Z="Inverse"
If X2 (not equal to) X1 then
Z2(X2/Y1) ; Zn(Z1-Z2) ; Z3(Z1+Zn) ; Z4(Z1+(Zn/2))
X3(Z4*Y1) ; X4(Z3*Y1) *if ZN unknown for expectedX<TargetX zn is positive number; if expectedX>TargetX Zn return a negative number This can also be readjusted for which object is being searched for or layout and template offsets with the appropriate code as it allows creation of all new objects in an updated template with an equal reference xy to the original template
Return(X3;Z3)
X3 or X4 ; Z3>Target
X3 ; Z3=Target *use X3 with coeffecients with power of one
X4 ; Z3=Target *use x4 for coeffecients with power of two
*Zn is the unknown difference of the Z component
