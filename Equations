Ohms law and reference difference allows using the know good values to find the difference from the expected results.
After determing the difference we can estimate the undefined loss or difference from what was predefined.
Using ohms law and reference difference together we can redefine the values to be much more accurately calculated and now are known to be good.

X proportional to Y
Y proportional to X
Z Inverse to X
Y proportion to Z
Temp ≠ target; for temp,Y *do not use 0.0-9.0 Use ohms law After the calculation has been made normal variable use should be able to be used with the new values. 
Reason for using constant at this stage is to prevent incorrect values being used for characterization

if Z for tempX<targetX z_corrected is positive number; if tempX>TargetX Z_corrected returns a negative number
new view for baseline, [ X;Y;Z ]give us our baseline corrected view equivalent to original view, correcting for the original weighted members being set incorrectly for the current condition of actual device.
Without limits to when calls are made and when adjustments are allowed will cause undesired behaviour as heat loss and gain will cause new view to become >plane-1 Reason for execution is actual has become < plane-1
coefficients with power of two and z power of one (xx/z yyz) this is the desired intent. To correct when weighted members has been determined to be set incorrectly by sampling after "max" charge cycle did not achieve a full charge after cycle completed and temperatures are within "target range" 
Recommend only using targeting when a new _view is being made. Do not allow continuous monitoring causes race condition. 
Remaining_level_layer should execute on original and not on copy.
Only use when an error occurs with target not achieved.
Use this only as a maintenance tool.
Always set a max limit for allowed "expansion" as with no limits variables grow to infinity.
If used as equation only it works well for physics suite for finding unknown weights.
XY = W, i=it/t where t is time. induced current is equal to the total induced current over time <-current loss over time=net induced current or i=Qt/t where Q is net current induced over time equally dependent on the avg current induced over time.
When current strategy is not a constant current rate for the full duration of charge cycle the rate of charge is not constant. If an incorrect calculation is being used to set target then incorrect charging strategy or current induction may be used.
By using a training session and resolving for any attribute variables that could not otherwise have been defined, characterizing the undefined difference allows for improvement. This can not be achieved without defined variables of original target. 
As a op kernel this method has been depreciated. Best Splits for Temp is not supported to be passed to user space and back to loader layer. However completing pass after charge complete gives new_i_max target "max limit" for -1. If cached at this stage as new GCC profile.
This would add a step for user before update charge device. Updating/Device/Attributes/GCC receive attribute/GCC update device profile/GCC update device.
Or google services could send device attributes periodically preventing any security concerns as no call would be required to be made to loader layer.Would be a small addition to the numerous data collection calls google already runs in the background.
and sent to GCC to update device profile characterization if that was possible? Then preconditioning might not be needed for initial "none" characterized attributes.? As attribute characterization is already completed. Only tensor training/ tensor loss monitoring and management would be required.
Use GCC. **Rebasing** No kernel Text only**Although it did work and only requires a single pass to set target and never requires another pass. Management requires Tensorflow_loss_learn/Thermal strategy/Max offset limiting/This is only a subset Going full Nueral Network & MatMul
