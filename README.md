# base_line_equation *Reason for maintenance helper execution is actual < target plane-1 Never execute for actual=>target plane-1 Use original members for reference
This is a simplified math & reference different equation for finding an unknown using the known. 
Correction for variable undefined.
The equation as used here is when two coeffecient members are proportiionally equal and one coefficent has an inverse relationship to one of the two proportionally equal coefficients.Depending on the target logY or Â XY use of z3 or z4 equation is used. Note that without Z3,Z4 the calculation causes regression and Z3 causes growth to the x member when logY is desired. Use Z4 when coefficients xy are second order to remain equally proportional to each other and have inverse relationships to first order inverse  member.
For targeting logY constant X+%shader excess to original Template use z3 This results in (x+%)*logY
This was originally written to deal with Pmu members overweight. Valid tests known are all ohms laws when an unknown resistance needs to be defined.
By the use of %shader could have linear targeting.Only used for charge strategy not continuous adjustment. There is no raw code as this is intended to be used as a building block using the equation for correct implementation. This is a maintenance utility helper tool only not a controller.**If maintaince has executed previously and maintaince has been determined to need to execute again , each layer of maintaince must be accounted for.Use the difference by executive additional maintaince against the maintenance layer for layer ++. Executing agaimst reference will cause incorrect actual values to be used.As the maintaince layer actual values are not = to reference but are proportional**
