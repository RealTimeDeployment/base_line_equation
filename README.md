# base_line_equation
This is a math equation for finding an unknown using the known. 
This can be applied to a wide variety of tools. This can correct for variables undefined.
This is used when two coeffecient members are proportiionally equal and one coefficent is inverse to the other two.Depending on the relationship exponetial of the 2 coefficient proprortionally equal members the use of z3 or z4 equation is used.Note that without Z3 the calculation causes regression and Z3 causes growth when proprtional coeeficients are of second order. Use Z4 when coefficients are 2nd power
For targeting Y1 constant which equals XY + %shader excess to original Template 
This was originally written to deal with Pmu members overweight, but other xyz axis alignment offset are possible. Valid tests known are all ohms laws when an unknown resistance needs to be defined.XXX
This also by the use of %shader could have linear targeting. This also leads to the possible unity of layers with the ability to reference back to original template and the ability to add template updates as needed. This is a great physics tool and a great utility maintenance tool. Aswell this is a great reference check tool. Also this can be used for correcting proportional ratio errorson 3
