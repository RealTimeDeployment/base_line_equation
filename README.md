Experimental # base_line_equation *Reason for maintenance helper execution is actual < target plane-1 Never execute for actual=>target plane-1 Use original members for reference
This is a simplified math & reference different equation for finding an unknown using the known. 
Correction for variable undefined.
The equation as used here is when two coeffecient members are proportiionally equal and one coefficent has an inverse relationship to one of the two proportionally equal coefficients.Depending on the target logY or  XY use of z3 or z4 equation is used. Note that without Z3,Z4 the calculation causes regression and Z3 causes growth to the x member when logY is desired. Use Z4 when coefficients xy are second order to remain equally proportional to each other and have inverse relationships to first order inverse  member.
For targeting logY constant X+%shader excess to original Template use z3 This results in (x+%)*logY
This was originally written to deal with Pmu members overweight. Valid tests known are all ohms laws when an unknown resistance needs to be defined.
By the use of %shader could have linear targeting.Only used for charge strategy not continuous adjustment. There is no raw code as this is intended to be used as a building block using the equation for correct implementation. This is a maintenance utility helper tool only not a controller.**If maintaince has executed previously and maintaince has been determined to need to execute again , each layer of maintaince must be accounted for.Use the difference by executive additional maintaince against the maintenance layer for layer ++. Executing agaimst reference will cause incorrect actual values to be used.As the maintaince layer actual values are not = to reference but are proportional**  
 The unknown equation "calculates" the memory leaks, calibrated for it and causes more buffer overflow, causing race condition. Also for some reason the program was watching every change and recalculating every change which it shouldn't be set up to do. Two edged sword. Equation does what it was supposed to by reading the loss and not just physical loss but software byte unit and memory loss, calculated the size of the loss memory leak, buffer overflow or any loss, and resizes the value unit to account for all losses. Also was seeing every temperature change and every sensor update as errors or offsets, very bad. Great for testing bad for live stream. As we can target areas of question and find any losses and the size of the losses. R0 works but not how it was hoped to work as it can't be used for program strategy because it is to specific.  It can be used to see miscalculated values but that about as far as I am willing to use it unfortunately because the system just can't handle it properly.
Optimization, unsuccessful,
If memory loss causes loss then optimization is not achieved as a leak is a spill over loss in pipeline and requires fixing the leak first. Need sealed container,  need to fix optimization so that it does not cause overflow, memory leaks and then race condition. Need to look at unit size and or byte size. Find point of buffer overflow, and stop overflow, find limit of buffer. Also look at byte offset alignment default failure. The good news is that it tries to do what it is designed to do. But with leaks should calculate overflow loss by first iteration-second iteration offset= R0 leak loss, overflow. Again unknown equation does what it is supposed to do. Works better and for more than was expected. Works to well As it causes mem leaks to be undetected by attempting correct for the leaks, but causes more leaks by doing this. Which revealed all the leaks that have been patched over to stop the leaks from occuring. As it detects and calculates memory loss and buffer overflow as R0. It also may have passed the test suite because the program calculations errors and tries to correct for errors and the test suite didn't know what to look for.
Question how is target calculated? What is the unit size? How are the coefficients being calculated? Byte unit size vs physics unit values and  differential equation and difference add equation. If unit 8000wInduction coefficient X target 4200 and actual is 4100 and Z is found at unit value size R0/2 for correct unit coefficient proportionally but if program is variable offset difference to a key unit offset of the induction and not to the Z and X coefficients and calculation for  new Y is from the coefficient variant, then Induction is XY of coefficient variants  proportionally =XY = W, i==it/t where t is time. To say that induced current is equal to the total induced current over time-current loss over time or i=◇Q/◇t where Q is current or the net current induced over time equally dependent on the avg current induced over time.
If the alignment offset is not to a cast of 4 or 8 then optimization must be relaxed to allow compatibility. If % Of difference is minimal and effort to offset result will be unequal cast to the byte then relax the optimization to null and optimization is voided until cast is equal to unite 4 or 8, or to say aligned
Rule is to follow proper utf8 To great of precision causes issues. Also a copy causes issues. Refactor by linux or vulkan with there calculationscalculations being corrected after reevaluating their strategy after seeing the equation with +delta vs - delta only may have already corrected the concern at the master.Smaster.So that additional corrections are not needed. The unknown variable equation allowed testing to see if calculation errors had been made for this particular case.
