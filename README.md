This is my version as i wrote it without knowledge of any other versions when it was written.  Some names associated where Adjustable weghts,and the known-good. The actual max < target_max  Never execute for actualto be >target plane-1 Use original members for reference to learn member values, cache corrected member values. Then use monitor_loss and pmu manager normally. Member values are used to track losses from there corrected values for pool actual remaining levels.
This is a simplified math & reference different equation for finding an unknown using the known. 
Correction for variable undefined.
The equation as used here is when two coeffecient members are proportiionally equal and one coefficent has an inverse relationship to one of the two proportionally equal coefficients.
This was originally written to deal with Pmu members overweight. Valid tests known are all ohms laws when an unknown resistance needs to be defined. Input values that do not follow proper laws will return incorrect values.
By the use of %shader could have linear targeting. Only used for charge strategy not continuous monitoring. This is the "fast learn", single pass *If maintaince has executed previously and maintaince has been determined to need to execute again , each layer of maintaince must be accounted for.Use the difference by executive additional maintaince against the maintenance layer for layer ++. Executing against reference will cause incorrect actual values to be used.As the maintaince layer actual values are not = to reference but are equivalent**  
 When set without proper limitations. The unknown equation "calculates" the memory leaks, calibrated for it and causes more buffer overflow, causing race condition. Also for some reason the program was watching every change and recalculating every change which it shouldn't be set up to do. Two edged sword. Equation does what it was supposed to by reading the loss and not just physical loss but software byte unit and memory loss, calculated the size of the loss memory leak, buffer overflow or any loss, and resizes the value unit to account for all losses. Also was seeing every temperature change and every sensor update as offsets, for constant current.  we can target areas of question and find losses and the size of the losses.
Optimization, unsuccessful,
If memory loss causes loss then optimization is not achieved as a leak is a spill in pipeline and requires fixing the leak first. Need sealed container,  need to fix optimization so that it does not cause overflow, memory leaks and then race condition. Need to look at unit size and or byte size. Find point of buffer overflow, and stop overflow, find limit of buffer. Also look at byte offset alignment default failure. The good news is that it tries to do what it is designed to do. But with leaks should calculate overflow loss by first iteration-second iteration offset= R0 leak loss, overflow. Again unknown equation does what it is supposed to do. Works better and for more than was expected. Works to well As it causes mem leaks to be undetected by attempting correct for the leaks, but causes more leaks by doing this. Which revealed all the leaks that have been patched over to stop the leaks from occuring. As it detects and calculates memory loss and buffer overflow as R0. It also may have passed the test suite because the program calculations errors and tries to correct for errors and the test suite didn't know what to look for.
Question how is target calculated? What is the unit size? How are the coefficients being calculated? Byte unit size vs physics unit values and  differential equation and difference add equation. If unit 8000wInduction coefficient X target 4200 and actual is 4100 and Z is found at unit value size R0 for correct unit coefficient proportionally and X is calculated using R0/2, but if program is variable offset difference to a key unit offset of the induction and not to the Z and X coefficients and calculation for  new Y is from the coefficient variant, then Induction is proportionally =XY = W, i==it/t where t is time. To say that induced current is equal to the total induced current over time-current loss over time or i=Qt/t. If inputs do not follow ohms law such as y=>x or z>x optimization should fail. As Y can not be greater than x and;  z if greater than x will yield 0 Y and optimization may set a negative value because weights are greater than pool.
If the alignment offset is not to a cast usable and aligned in some cases , murmurhash3 then limitations must be relaxed to allow compatibility. If % Of difference is minimal and effort to offset result will be unequal cast to the byte then relax the optimization to exit as successful with zero offset required, limitations to the number of  attempts to complete the optimization successfully to prevent looping is recommended, 1 attempt will exit without causing concerns and give warning that optimization was unsuccessful and direct to use std.
Rule is to follow proper unit byte size 32   To great of precision causes issues. Also a copy causes issues. The unknown variable equation allowed testing to see if calculation errors had been made for this particular case.
