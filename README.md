# base_line_equation
This is a simple math & reference different equation for finding an unknown using the known. 
This can be applied to a wide variety of tools. Correction for variable undefined.
The equation as used here is when two coeffecient members are proportiionally equal and one coefficent has an inverse relationship to one of the two proportinally equal coefficients.Depending on the relationship exponetial of the 2 coefficient proportionally equal members to the inverse member the use of z3 or z4 equation is used. Note that without Z3 the calculation causes regression and Z3 causes growth to the x member when proportional coeficients are of second order. Use Z4 when coefficients xy are second order to remain equally proportional to each other and to the inverse first order member. In this way z4 uses Zn%shader.
For targeting Y1 constant X+%shader excess to original Template use z3
This was originally written to deal with Pmu members overweight, but other xyz axi alignment offset are possible. Valid tests known are all ohms laws when an unknown resistance needs to be defined.
By the use of %shader could have linear targeting. The ability to reference back to original reference and the ability to correct template as needed with this simple equation to build on. There is no raw code as this is intended to be used as a building block using the equation for correct implementation.
