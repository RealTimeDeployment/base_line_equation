# base_line_equation
This is a math equation for finding an unknown using the known. 
This can be applied to a wide variety of tools. This can correct for variables undefined.
Note that without Z3 the calculation causes regression and Z3 causes growth.
For targeting Y1 constant Z3*Y1=X4(X4/Z3=Y1) which equals XY + % excess to original Template 
With(X3*Y3) template new XY = template old XY This was originally written to deal with PIM members overweight, but other xyz axi axis alignment offset are possible. Valid tests known are all ohms laws when an unknown resistance needs to be defined.XX/Z YY/Z X=YZ Y=X/Z Z=X/Y
This also by the use of the %shader could lead to adjustability. This also leads to the possible unity of layers with the ability to reference back to original template and the ability to add templates forwardly
